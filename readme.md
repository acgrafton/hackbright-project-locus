## Locus
Locus is a tool that helps people looking to move to quickly find out if a given location has the places and services that they want nearby. Users save a list of place types in their criteria and then can get locations scored by entering in the address and see the places that meet the criteria on a map. Scored locations can be viewed together so that users can compare locations based on their scores.

## About Me
Angela has always had an interest in coding deriving from her work as a Revenue Management professional in the hospitality industry and working in various industry software systems as the field evolved. Working full-time and taking care of two young children left little time to pursue other interests but due to the Covid-19 impact on travel, she found herself furloughed for the first time. With encouragement from her software engineer brother, she took the opportunity to take the Hackbright Software Engineering Prep course and found that her detail-oriented skill and love for creative problem-solving and critical analysis crossed over seamlessly into computer programming,  She entered Hackbrightâ€™s Full-time Software Engineering after finding it a great fit with its emphasis on Python and additional key programming languages as well as providing community support for her journey down this new path. She is enthusiastic and dedicated to launching a new career as a Full-Stack Developer.
